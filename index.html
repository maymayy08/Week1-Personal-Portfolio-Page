                In my spare time, I enjoy making an art of 3D origami. Despitely, the 3D origami is made out of 100s of coloured papers and transforms into complex, multidimensional models. The process involve in folding 100 or 1000 of tiny pieces of paper, each one is carefully crafted and taking care to assembled in order to build intricate shape.
                In the image above, this is the 3D origami of bird, cats and Piku I have made.</p>
