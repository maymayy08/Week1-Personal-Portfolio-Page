                <br>
                In my spare time, I enjoy making an art of 3D origami. Despitely, the 3D origami is made out of 100s of coloured papers and transforms into complex, multidimensional models. The process involves in folding 1000s tiny pieces of paper, each one is carefully crafted and taking care of in order to assembled it together to build intricate shape.
                The image above outline the 3D origami of bird, cats and Pikachu I have made.</p>
